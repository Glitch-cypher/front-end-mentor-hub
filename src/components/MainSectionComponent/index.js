JavaScript has become an essential web technology along with HTML and CSS, as most browsers implement JavaScript. Thus, You must learn JavaScript if you want to get into web development, and you must learn it well if you're planning on being a front-end developer or on using JavaScript for backend development.`,

JavaScript is mainly used for frontend development, and there are various tools that will allow you to quickly get a working prototype with JavaScript. Nonetheless, you should first focus on obtaining a solid understanding of JavaScript. Additionally, beginners may quickly find it difficult to grasp the concepts of how JavaScript works, and the language has several designs that make it easy for beginners to shoot themselves in the foot. Finding an experienced JavaScript mentor will likely help you stay on the right track and ease your learning process.`,

      It‚Äôs time to learn about servers, we will be using Node.JS and Express. Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
      Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. We will also be diving into Express. The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

      description: `Diving into the backend üëÄ.
      We will be learning about databases and APIs. Front end development involves what a user sees on the screen when they open a specific URL owned by you. Even in a completely static environment (with only HTML/CSS), when someone opens a website, some server on the planet needs to respond to you with those HTML and CSS files.

      That server is just a computer, just like the one you use yourself to browse the internet. But it has been tuned for performance, and doesn't have unnecessary components like a mouse or keyboard attached. And it sits with tons of other computers probably in a data warehouse.
      
      Programming those computers in some special way is called back end development.
      
      You may think that backend development is called what it is because it runs behind the user's back. A visitor to your website never really "accesses" the back end completely. They just communicate with your server, either directly through ports for very limited access (like transferring HTML/CSS files) or not even that ‚Äì buried deep under CDNs or firewalls (like Cloudflare). `,

      description: ` 
      Our apps need to have authorization and authentication to be secure. There are several contributing factors that make designing good authentication flows a challenge. For instance, OAuth flows work ever slightly so differently across providers. And handling a client-side only flow is quite different than a middleware based flow. Further, there are different kinds of authentication flows: sometimes, you may want a passwordless authentication and other times, you may want an old-school username and password based flow. And once you have implemented an auth flow, handling user authorizations is an altogether different challenge.
